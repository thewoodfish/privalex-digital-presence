    about:
      "The Advanced Data Protection Practitioner (ADPP) is the only programme of its kind. While certification courses teach the rules, the ADPP builds the judgement needed to apply them. Over two months, participants study all major privacy frameworks side by side — the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), sector specific guidelines and regulations and ISO/IEC 27701, and develop the practical skills needed to manage data protection programmes, advise organisations, and operate as genuine privacy professionals at international standard. Topics include: conducting DPIAs across jurisdictions, breach management and regulatory notification, drafting privacy policies and consent frameworks, cross-border transfer mechanism design, building DPO programmes inside organisations, privacy-by-design for products and services, and privacy consulting frameworks. This programme is capped at a small cohort size per intake to ensure quality of instruction and individual attention. Graduates of the ADPP are equipped to practice as DPOs, privacy consultants, and advisory professionals at the highest level.",

            The School of Data Protection and Privacy is the flagship school of PrivaLex Academy. It
            is the only institution in Nigeria and among the very few in West Africa that combines
            the NDPC regulatory credential, a PECB ISO-aligned global certification, and a
            proprietary advanced practitioner programme within a single coherent pathway. You can
            take one programme or progress through all four. The pathway is designed so each
            qualification builds on the last.
